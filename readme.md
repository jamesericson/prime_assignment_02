People of Tau
-------------

The goal of this web application is to pull in data from an outside server
and display it to the user. The content of the data consists of profiles from
classmates, from the cohort of Tau. Profiles consist of an image, person's name,
and a quick blurb about him or her.

Tech outlined:

  -- .ajax via jquery gets the outside JSON

  -- an array holds received content

  -- dynamic buttons for each profiles are created for index navigation

  -- jquery provides the visual transitions between profiles through animations

  -- user can click 'next' and 'previous' buttons to advance or click on a name

  -- after 10sec, the viewed profile is advanced automatically
